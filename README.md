# Project Fission #

Project Fission is a personal website creation tool. 

## Quickstart Guide ##

*Requires `pandoc` and `python`.*

In your bash shell (Terminal.app on macOS) enter the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/njha02.github.io
cd ./njha02.github.io
python setup.py
```


This will create a local copy of the Project Fission code and install the required dependencies.

Open and edit the `config.yml` file using an editor of your choice. `nano` is suggested for those who aren't familiar with command-line editors.

```
cd fission;
open config.yml; #alternatively: nano config.yml;
```

Fill in the form with your own personal details. You can replace the default icon, i.e. `pencil` with any other icon on [fontawesome.io](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) by replacing the icon name.

Here's how my personal `config.yml` looks:

```

After filling in `config.yml`, run the `build.py` script.

`python build.py`

Lastly, replace the blank profile picture and resume with your own copies.

```
mv /path/to/profile.jpg ./images/profile.jpg
mv /path/to/resume.pdf ./resume.pdf
``` 

Congratulations! You now have your own personal website! Open it up and check it out!
